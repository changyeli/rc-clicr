This the repo for HINF 5610 final project.



## Data

We use [CliCR](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/CliCR%3A-A-Dataset-of-Clinical-Case-Reports-for-Suster-Daelemans/cd36768795c696c990ff5c89be8d8b3b205858bd), a dataset of clinical case reports for machine learning reading comprehension. If you want get the access to the dataset, please follow this [link](http://github.com/clips/clicr) for more details.



## Files & Folders

- ```requirements.txt```: the necessary Python 3 packages. Please make sure you have Python version >= 3.6. Note that PyTorch in this file supports GPU computing. If you would like to run models using CPU, please modify this file accordingly.



## Models

NNLM


## Note

Part of the utility code in NNLM folder are from the original artical[link](http://github.com/clips/clicr). To make the code NNLM self-contained, they are also included here.
